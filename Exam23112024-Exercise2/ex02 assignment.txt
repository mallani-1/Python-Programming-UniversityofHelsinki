This directory contains my solution for Exercise 2 of the exam, implemented in Python to identify the positions of a specified gene sequence within a genome string.

## üîç Task Overview

The task was to develop a program to achieve the following:

1. **Functionality**:
   - Implement a function `find_gene_positions(gene, genome)` to search for all occurrences of a given gene sequence in a larger genome string.

2. **Return Values**:
   - The function should return a list of starting positions where the gene sequence appears in the genome.
   - If the gene sequence is not found, return `None`.

3. **Testing**:
   - Test the function with different gene sequences to ensure it handles multiple occurrences and non-existent sequences correctly.

## üìÑ Example Interaction:

```plaintext
genome = "ATCGAGATCGACGATCGTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCGATCGA"

gene1 = "TAGCTA"
gene2 = "ATCGA"
gene3 = "X"

print(find_gene_positions(gene1, genome))  # Outputs: [16, 22]
print(find_gene_positions(gene2, genome))  # Outputs: [0, 7, 31]
print(find_gene_positions(gene3, genome))  # Outputs: None
